Compiling:
make all

Executing:
./sim <number of processes> <Percent of System processes> <Percent of System CPU process> <Percent of User CPU process>

INFO
User runs the program with the total number of processes and absolute percentages of system, system CPU, and User CPU preocesses.
Program then translates percentages to numbers (more accurately for larger number of processes).
It then creates a sorted linked list of the processes, based on their arrival times.
It then gives user option to simulate a number of scheduling schemes.

Supported Scheduling Schemes:
  FCFS
  SJF
  SJF with preemption
  Priority with ageing
  Priority with ageing and preemption
  Round Robin with varying quanta
  Multi Level queue with ageing and preemption between the queues
  Multilevel feedback queue with ageing and preemption between the queues.

Following parameters are calculated
  Average Waiting time
  Average Turn around time
  Average Response time
  Average Service time
  Cpu Utilisation
  Throughput
  Load average
  
NOTE: data becomes more reliable wih higher number of processes
